### Creating a GitHub Repository

> You have a directory of scripts and data files on your computer that you want to share with collaborators using GitHub. You create a new repository on your GitHub account called “repo123” that has the following URL: https://github.com/user123/repo123.git.

> Which of the following sequences of commands will convert the directory on your computer to a Github directory and create and add a descriptive “read me” file to the new repository?


* echo “A new repository with my scripts and data” > README.txt
* git init
* git add README.txt
* git commit -m "First commit. Adding README file."
* git remote add origin `https://github.com/user123/repo123.git`
* git push
