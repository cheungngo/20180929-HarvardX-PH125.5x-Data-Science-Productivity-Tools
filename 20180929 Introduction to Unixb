# You can’t use your computer’s mouse in a terminal. How can you see a line of code that you executed previously?
# Use the up arrow


# pwd Output

# Assume a student types pwd and gets the following output printed to the screen: /Users/student/Documents.
# Then, the student enters the following commands in sequence:

mkdir projects
cd projects

# What will be printed to the screen if the student types pwd after executing the two lines of code shown above?

# mkdir projects would make a new dir called 'projects'
# cd projects would change your to that directory
